# firstproject_rere
this is my first project to study machine learning specifically image classification, natural language processing, time series and image classification with deployment

In this class, I have completed 3 submissions as a condition for graduating from this class, including:
1. The first project is to create a Machine Learning model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) programming with Tensorflow. #NLP
2. The second project is to create a machine learning model with time-series data. #timeseries
3. The last project, create an Image Classification model with a Deployment model operating TF.Lite for Android #imageclassification
